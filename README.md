# **Seat Reservation System**

## **Overview**
This project implements a **file-based seat reservation system** using Java. The system simulates a **database-like behavior** by storing seat reservations in a binary file (`seats.dat`). It supports:

- **Automatically initialize seats.dat if not exists**
- **Booking consecutive seats**
- **Canceling reservations**
- **Concurrency control**
- **Efficient bitwise operations** for memory optimization
- **Input validation**

## **How It Works**
### **1 Seat Storage Format**
Each row is stored as a **single byte (8 bits)** where each **bit represents a seat**:
```
Bit position:   7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
Seats:         S8 S7 S6 S5 S4 S3 S2 S1
```
- `0` â†’ Available seat
- `1` â†’ Booked seat

### **2 File Handling**
- `DataAccess.java` manages **binary file operations**.
- The **file persists seat reservations** across multiple runs.

### **3 Concurrency Handling**
- Though not specifically required, in a real collaborative project SeatManager class maybe used by other classes. 
- To prevent race condition, it's created following singleton pattern.  
- And added **Row-level locks**.

## **Build & Run Instructions**
### **ðŸ”¹ Build the Project (Gradle)**
Run the following command to build the project. 
It creates a flight_booking.sh shell script for users to execute the program. 
```sh
./gradlew build
```
### **ðŸ”¹ Running the Program**
Use the provided **shell script** to execute the reservation system:
```sh
./flight_booking.sh BOOK A1 3
./flight_booking.sh CANCEL A1 3
```
---
## **Testing**
### **ðŸ”¹ Run Unit Tests**
Execute all tests with:
```sh
./gradlew test
```

### **ðŸ”¹ Test Coverage**
| **Test Suite**        | **Purpose** |
|----------------------|------------|
| `SeatManagerTest`    | Tests seat booking & cancellations |
| `DataAccessTest`     | Tests file read/write operations |
| `BookingSystemTest`  | Tests CLI argument handling |
